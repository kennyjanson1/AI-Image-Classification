# AI Image Classification: Detecting AI-Generated vs. Real Images

This project focuses on classifying whether a given image is AI-generated or a real photograph using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It was developed as a part of a Software Engineering course project and integrates both backend and frontend components.

## 🔍 Project Description

With the rise of AI-generated media, distinguishing between real and synthetic images has become crucial. This project leverages deep learning techniques to predict whether an uploaded image is a genuine photograph or generated by AI.

We use a CNN model trained on a small dataset of 1,085 images, classified into two categories: **REAL** and **FAKE**. The project includes a TensorFlow-based image classifier and a simple frontend interface connected using Flask.

## 📊 Model Performance

The model achieved the following evaluation metrics on the test set:

- **Precision:** 81.96%
- **Recall:** 76.92%
- **Accuracy:** 79.68%

> Note: Due to limited data (~1,085 samples), the model's performance is moderate. Higher accuracy could be achieved with larger datasets, but high-resolution AI/real images require significant memory (11–20GB).

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Flask (for frontend integration)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User uploads an image via frontend.
2. Image is resized to 32x32 pixels and normalized.
3. The pre-trained CNN model (.h5 file) makes a prediction.
4. The model predicts its class:
   - Output > 0.5 → **REAL**
   - Output ≤ 0.5 → **FAKE (AI-generated)**

## 🧠 Model Training
To retrain the model or test with your own dataset, use the Google Colab notebook below:

## 📌 Future Improvements
1. Use larger datasets with more diversity and resolution.
2. Fine-tune model using pre-trained architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet).
3. Add adversarial image detection features.
